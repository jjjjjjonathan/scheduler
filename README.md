# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page app (SPA) built with React that allows users to book appointments with available interviewers, on Monday to Friday from 12:00-5:00pm. Users can choose the day and time slot they would like to create an appointment, and they can delete or update appointments with a new name or selecter interviewer.

With Web Sockets, users can also see real-time updates of the schedule when anyone creates, updates, or deletes an appointment. Data is stored on a PostgreSQL database.
